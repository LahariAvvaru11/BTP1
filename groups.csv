There is no question that hardware has been white-hot these past few years.
Exits such as Nest and Oculus Rift are just some of the more recent data
points in why hardware is hot.

There is plenty that we know about hardware. We know for instance that
hardware is hard. We know that mass manufacturing is fraught with difficulty.
We know that the proliferation of Adruinos and Raspberry Pis have lowered the
barrier to hardware entry.

We also know that not all hardware is the same. Certainly something like the
Nest Thermostat is intrinsically different from something like the hoverboard,
even though both are fundamentally made up of the same components, such as a
processing unit, PCB board & assembly, sensors, casing, etc.

What is it about the Nest Thermostat, or even the Autonomous Car that sets it
apart from the ""onesy"" pieces of hardware such as the hoverboards or ""dumb""
cars?

The answer, IMHO, is the Connectivity and Intelligence that is built into one
set of devices versus the other. A Connected and Intelligent device is more
than just a piece of hardware -- it has the capacity to learn from its peer-
device, change its behavior over time, and become integrated into- rather than
just be added onto- a consumer's life.

Connected & Intelligent devices have requirements that extend those which we
traditionally think of as being ""merely"" hardware. On top of everything from
the traditional component selection, prototyping, manufacturing, etc., each of
these devices now also has to contend with issues such as privacy, security,
networking, authentication, etc.

This difference, again IMHO, is what sets apart the Hardware 2.0 era of Smart
Home, Smart City, and Smart AllSortsOfThings from their predecessors. The
Boston Connected & Intelligent Device Meetup is intended to be a platform for
discussion, design, growth, and promotion of such devices.

Apache CloudStack is open source software designed to deploy and manage large
networks of virtual machines, as a highly available, highly scalable
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud computing platform. CloudStack is
used by a number of service providers to offer public cloud services, and by
many companies to provide an on-premises (private) cloud offering, or as part
of a hybrid cloud solution.

CloudStack is a turnkey solution that includes the entire ""stack"" of features
most organizations want with an IaaS cloud: compute orchestration, Network-as-
a-Service, user and account management, a full and open native API, resource
accounting, and a first-class User Interface (UI).

CloudStack currently supports the most popular hypervisors: VMware, KVM,
XenServer and Xen Cloud Platform (XCP).  
Users can manage their cloud with an easy to use Web interface, command line
tools, and/or a full-featured RESTful API. In addition, CloudStack provides an
API that's compatible with AWS EC2 and S3 for organizations that wish to
deploy hybrid clouds.

**Join the CloudStack SF Bay Area Users Group**

Anyone is welcome! Come and chat over pizza and drinks.  

We will have talks from members of the foundation, committers, and users of
CloudStack discussing various aspects of its development, history,
architecture, operation and in general the direction of the project in this
and upcoming meetups. And most importantly - how to get started on
contributing yourself! Anyone is welcome to the group and we'll have beginner
sessions available as well.

causing customer delays and significantly impacting business not just in the
US, but impacted globally in the case of Sabre.

• There are hundreds of cloud providers to choose from in the market today.
Not all are enterprise ready, despite their claims. And let's face it, many
have paid or biased positioning in leading independent studies released by
highly respected IT research companies.

• How does a CIO or CTO, and today's CEO, _**tasked to identify the essential
drivers of a business, navigate?**_ Leading independent think tanks (Gartner,
Aberdeen, IDC, etc) are not fully equipped to provide battle-tested and deep
thorough analysis regarding the critical issues of cloud security, network
throughput, reliability and ROI when it comes to enterprise grade customers.
Researchers can only convey what they read and disseminate their opinions, not
facts. **Gartner (NYSE:IT) even has in its disclaimer that all analysis is
""opinion and not based on facts.""**

Architecture Katas.



**What is an Architectural Kata- you ask ?** Read on...
<http://blogs.tedneward.com/2010/06/17/Architectural+Katas.aspx>



The first time, I did Architecture Katas was with   [Ted
Neward](http://twitter.com/tedneward) at a workshop he hosted at   [NFJS 2011
in Boston](http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/conference/boston/2011/03/home). I
quite liked the experience. It was fun and very educational.

Three things I liked the most about the workshop was

A) I exercised my brain in way that I normally don't get a chance to do (I
know!! I know !!)

B) I heard some excellent ideas from others - who obviously had worked on very
different products and had different experiences than mine

C) It was very interesting experience forming a group with a bunch of people I
had just met and start to build something together.

When I talked to others who had attended the same workshop, I realized that
there are others as well, who are interested as well.



**What to expect ?**

Its not your usual user group where you come to hear someone's opinion. People
will be coming to hear you opinion and you will observe how others approach
problem solving.

All attendees will be separated into groups- of three or more. Each group is
then given an architectural problem.

The problem statement has requirements and is in some sense vague. You can
make reasonable assumption and can approach the ""game-master"" for
clarification.

You then have about 45 minutes to discuss the problem and brainstorm within
your group. At the end- you give a presentation and others ask questions and
critique your proposal (No flashy presentation slides !)



**Where and how often do we meet ?**

We meet in Burlington, MA .Once a month. On or near the 2nd Wednesday of the
month

of machines

b) build industrial IoT applications and predictive APIs at 10x the speed at
1/10 the cost

Because with Predix we can.

Founders of this group believe that Predix will help conceive, deliver and
scale some of the most important industrial advances of the next 10-20 years.

knowledge of Predix, its use cases and applications.

**How.  **

food and drinks on all things Predix:

∙ How-To’s

∙ Review of Predix Services

∙ Do’s and Don’ts

∙ Best Practices in User Experience

∙ Application Templates

∙ Building predictive APIs

∙ Security on the edge, in the cloud, and in transit

programmers or aspiring Python programmers in the Boston area. Or even if you
have no clue what Python is, but you're interested in learning to program.
It's a great language to learn if you have no prior programming experience.

Our goal is to get a larger number of women coding and involved in the open
source community. Developers and aspiring developers only, please. We
encourage all women to come out to our meetups. If anything is said during a
meetup or in any PyLadies Boston forum, please contact the organizers. We want
this to be a welcoming environment for all attendees and ask that everyone be
treated respectfully. We follow the [PyLadies Code of
Conduct](http://www.pyladies.com/CodeOfConduct/).

Join us on IRC! #pyladies-boston

**Pyladies Boston is for women and genderqueer individuals only. Men who join
will be removed from the group.** Nothing personal. If you're interested in
learning more about why we are women-only, read the articles in the ""Why Women
Only?"" section on our [resources page](http://boston.pyladies.com/resources/).

**Please note:** We highly discourage solicitation from recruiters unless
explicitly invited or are sponsoring an event. We are here to learn, to hack,
and support women in the Python developers' community. Job postings are
welcome on our forum.

What to expect at our meetups:

**Presentation nights (Monthly meetings)** : These will be presentations put
on by group members and other women (and the rare man) who are in Boston's
programming community. We welcome talks about any relevant subject... it does
not have to be strictly Python! We will not generally be installing things.
However, feel free to email the organizers (boston[at]pyladies[dot]com)
anytime if you are having trouble getting setup for a meeting. We also get
there about 30 minutes early as well and are happy to help before (or after!)
the meetup. The expected level of knowledge is just basic Python. Questions
are always welcome, but if it's really basic, we will ask you if we can answer
it later. If you can, also come grab a drink with us after the meetup!

**Beginner meetups** : Bring on your install problems! This is 100% about
making sure beginners are up and running. Our beginner meetups are weekly
(alternating Saturday and Sunday) and are project based. Don't have a project?
No problem! You can still come and we'll help you get started.

**Hack Days** : We like building things together! Open to suggestions as to
what we should build. We have coded our website during a hack day and have
plans to build Django apps in other hack days. In general, we'll spend at
least two hours trouble shooting installs, then the next four actually
building something cool! Also a good place to have install problems.

hardcore designer types - PHP/Perl/.NET/Python/django addicts - ...Fortran
devs?! - looking for a tech/entrepreneur/new business story to cover -
Objective-C experts and iPhone/iPad/Apple product pundits - engineers and
managers and CTOs looking for co-founders to join their angel/VC-backed tech
startup - looking to write articles/stories about the obscure, interesting,
hilarious hacks you've pulled off - totally oblivious and just wandered in
because they heard there was booze (!?) - building a top-secret app out of
their basement that's going to change the way the world does X; like ""Facebook
for Squirrels"" - scrambling to find a partner to work with on a well-paying
contract that's just a wee bit too much workload for the anticipated deadline
- heroes, because they're part of the burgeoning community that will reverse
all this insane brain-drain - incredibly talented, smart, entrepreneurial go-
getters who are absolutely dangerous to the status quo - pretty bloody
interesting, because seriously, if they're coming out for drinks ON A MONDAY
(or Tuesday, or Wednesday) NIGHT... they've gotta be.

software or hardware hacker/h4ck3r (or maybe just a hack) -

everyone can learn in a supportive environment. Our courses focus on coding,
leveraging existing technology, and having something to show for it (aka
building sweet websites).

infographics and videos to explain the concept in plain and persuasive terms,
engaging and involving the public in a dialogue about our mission through
events, petitions, and canvassing, reaching out to media such as blogs,
podcasts, and general news, and conducting talks in relevant forums.

hesitate.  

**Why Forth?**

• Forth is one of the few environments that is totally comprehensible by one
person.

• Forth has no inherent fixed syntax -- programming is done by extending the
language to your application. Thus, it can become what ever you need it to be.

• Forth has a ""low floor; high ceiling"" approach to abstraction -- that is, it
can be both low level, high level and anywhere in-between.

• You can get an application to run in a minuscule amount of flash or RAM.

• Forth is likely the most compact way to represent software.

• You can try things out interactively in real time as you build your system.

• The compiling functionality is an exposed part of the language like
everything else.

**And now for some details...**

**Upcoming Scheduled Meetups:** In general, we meet once a month, from
6:30-9pm, with 6:30-7pm for networking and food, and 7-9pm for presentations.
Presentations are usually 40min each. And a meetup with this group does Not
have to fall on our regular schedule, we are more than happy to schedule
additional meetups in a month.  

**Attendance:** We usually have an attendance of approx. 30-60+ depending on
location and topic - and we normally hold these Meetups in the Boston area -
however, we are branching out to other areas/facilities. Our attendees are
generally in the middle ground between novice and expert, with many in the
dev/ops space. If an RSVP list is desired, this can be provided to the host
sponsor, however, it ONLY includes the member's Meetup profile name (may not
be their real name) and profile link - it does Not contain direct email
contact info.  

**Presentations:** If you wish to present, contact the moderator at
awsmeetup@extremereach.com. Suggest a topic and an upcoming meeting(s) that
you would be available to present. Then we will need an abstract of the
presentation (title and descriptive info) and a bit about the presenter (brief
bio, just a few words). We generally have 2-3 presentations/presenters per
Meetup without repetition from recent past meetups. If 2 presentations, then
these are usually 40min with Q&A. Usually the main sponsor is provided the
choice of topic and presentation slot.  
Our attendees are looking for technical depth and NOT a sales pitch - so
please keep this in mind when proposing and creating your presentation.
Sometimes it is what you don't say that is important - for example, if you
wanted to expose the need for your solution, you can point out all the Amazon-
native methods of solving a problem, and in the presentation it becomes clear
that an additional solution is needed. Again, we stay away from sales
presentations.  
It’s important that speakers speak loud and clear, in the event a PA system is
not available. Also, when questions are asked, the presenter should repeat the
question so that all can hear and understand the context of the answer.

**Presentation - Slides:** Usually there are requests for slides after a
presentation. We request that presenters post a link to the slides used, as a
comment in the applicable Meetup event page. Any comments go to the entire
group of subscribers (who have notifications enabled).

**Sponsorship:** A sponsor (location/food) has their logo posted on our Meetup
site with link to their site, and is provided time during the Meetup to
address attendees. Please see [this link](http://www.meetup.com/The-Boston-
Amazon-Web-Services-Meetup-Group/sponsors/) for examples.  
For help with identifying WHEN would be a good meetup to sponsor, review our
upcoming meetups, looking for events not yet sponsored. And, you can always
suggest an additional meetup, supplementing our regular monthly meetup.
Special events are welcome.  
Review the [upcoming meetups first](http://www.meetup.com/The-Boston-Amazon-
Web-Services-Meetup-Group/), then reach out to the moderator at
awsmeetup@extremereach.com  

**Sponsorship - Food/Drink:** We really appreciate our food sponsors and
provide them extra time in self-promotion. Food and drink selection is up to
the sponsor. Usually a mixed assortment of pizza and salad works well - but
this is up to the sponsor. Pretty simple fare for this crowd - and usually no
alcohol (but optional if the venue allows). The food sponsor makes all the
arrangements - including flatware, napkins, cups, plates, etc. Food is
consumed as people arrive and mingle around 6:30pm, and we usually get started
with the presentations by 7pm. To help with arranging food, here is a [link to
ezCater](https://www.ezcater.com/raf/9190f46efd), which makes it easy to
select a restaurant close to the venue, estimate the food required to support
the 50-60 people, place the order online, and make the delivery arrangements.
Expect to pay approx. $450 for food/drink.  

**Sponsorship - Location:** We are open to a variety of locations. Minimum
requirements include a facility that can host approx. 60 attendees, with
projector and screen available. The only time we have needed amplification is
when the meeting area has significant background noise (like certain climate
control systems, or open environments where sound does not carry well). The
facility should support groups who allow food and drink on premise. Please
specify if alcohol is Not permitted, and/or if there are drinks/snacks or
benefits that the facility supplies beyond the space hosting. Usually,
attendance requires RSVP for security check-in (if required). Be aware that
Meetup members do Not necessarily use their legal name in their profile. Any
prerequisites need to be spelled out (like requiring attendees to sign an NDA,
or updating their profile with their legal name). The host location sponsor is
responsible for posting signage to make it very clear where attendees need to
go for the meetup. Please supply any special instructions with regard to
directions, parking, security check-in, etc. - these will be posted on the
Meetup site.  
  
Note: We have arranged with Amazon to use their Boston office several times a
year. In general, these Meetups are reserved for sponsors who do Not have a
facility to offer. If you require a facility, there are many locations
throughout the Boston area, including places like [WeWork](http://wework.com),
that can be contacted to help facilitate a meeting space.  

**Sponsorship - Other Items:** There are other forms of sponsorship available,
including supplying swag, offering door prizes for info cards being filled
out, and covering the Meetup site hosting fees. Please reach out to the
moderator for further details and arrangements. awsmeetup@extremereach.com  

**Promotion of Other Events:** We receive many requests to post outside
events, functions, positions, and other items to the Meetup group. Members
have provided direct feedback that they do Not want any sales presentations or
unrelated solicitations. So, we keep it simple, stay focused on the purpose of
this Meetup, and provide opportunities for companies to sponsor or present,
and make announcements during the Meetup. In addition, comments can be posted
to any of the scheduled Meetup pages on the Meetup site. These comments go out
to the entire membership (who have notifications enabled).

**Attendee List:** We are often asked about providing presenters and sponsors
the attendee list. Unfortunately, many Meetup registrants use nicknames, and
emails are not available. If an RSVP list is desired, this can be provided to
the host sponsor, however, it ONLY includes the member's Meetup profile name
(may not be their real name) and profile link - it does Not contain direct
email contact info.  
However, presenters/sponsors can post to the Meetup site, commenting on the
particular meeting page, which goes out to the entire group (who have
notifications enabled). In the comments you can indicate follow-up contact
info, offer slides, and drive response to another web link where more info can
be gathered from attendees.  

**What Next?  **  
_Sponsors:_ Identify a meetup date and reach out to the moderator with a
description of your desired involvement, and any additional questions not
answered above.  
_Presenters:_ Provide topic/abstract and indicate when you could be available
to provide the presentation.  

**Reaching Mark Annati, the group moderator:** Emails to Mark should contain
the word ‘meetup’. Contact: Mark Annati, VP of IT, Extreme Reach, Inc.,

Test faster.  Release Sooner.

Everyone wants to release the next hot app or bulletproof their website. But
until now, it took a unique breed to thoroughly test them and to ensure
they’ll perform at scale. That’s because functional and performance testing
have traditionally been challenging, complex, costly and time-consuming. But
not anymore. SOASTA is driven by a radical idea: Make powerful testing
accessible to anyone. Do it in the cloud. Make it visual and far less complex.
Deliver immediate actionable intelligence in real time. And incorporate
testing for gesture and touch interfaces. Our SOASTA Platform, products and

affordable and exceptionally effective. And we think that’s cool.

what you can do today.

What becomes possible tomorrow is super exciting and scary at the same time.

interested in doing so, this Meetup is for you. Our goal is to create an
environment that's welcoming, fun, and educational.

A paradox...

The argument for open source (""free"" as in speech) software is stronger than
ever.

GNU/Linux has been wildly successful in the server market.

Desktop GNU/Linux operating systems like Ubuntu provide a rich end-user
experience on par or better than commercial rivals in many respects.

...Yet the uptake of using GNU/Linux as an end-user (desktop/laptop) operating
system still lags. This Meetup aims to end that by:

1\. Creating a community of GNU/Linux on the desktop enthusiasts.

2\. Providing a venue where GNU/Linux questions can get asked by users of all
levels.

3\. Fostering GNU/Linux on the desktop evangelism. Let's spread the word!

We welcome long time GNU/Linux enthusiasts, those who've heard of GNU/Linux
but aren't even sure what it is, and everyone in between. Join us!

**We're part of BLU!** BLU is the **Boston Linux & Unix User Group** and has
been meeting actively since 1994.  BLU does a fantastic job of covering topics
across the broad spectrum of GNU/Linux, from technical topics to end-user
topics.  I'm excited that BLU has invited our group to become a sub\- group of
theirs.  This gives us tremendous support from more experienced users and
allows us to coordinate events.  As a sub\- group, we aim to focus on using
GNU/Linux on the desktop and attracting new and less technical users to the
platform.  To learn more about BLU, please visit [http://www.

Events format varies from speakers to panels, job fairs, networking, or code
labs. Emerging technology topics are often mixed in with app development,
HTML5, Hadoop, Python, Eclipse, JavaScript, Java, Machine Learning, HBASE,
MapReduce, MongoDB, NoSQL, PHP, Agile, Ruby on Rails (RoR), Swift, iOS,
Android, R, Frameworks, IDEs, OO, Cloud, Angular.JS, Node.JS, Mobile, Business
Intelligence, and UI/UX.

Absolutely!  **A much better question is  how, and in what new ways, can we:**

a) train more computers to teach themselves by sifting through massive amounts
of data coming out of all sorts of places  

b) make these computers available through an API to provide a high-quality
answer to anyone who is in need.

TensorFlow, and help change the world!?

their knowledge of TensorFlow, its use cases and applications.

**How.**  Join our group for a regular dose of human interaction,
conversations, smiles, food and drinks on all things TensorFlow:

• How-To's & Best Practices

• Tutorials

• Models

• Algorithms

• Multi-GPU Autoscaling in the cloud

• Tools & Integrations

19726181,Hyperledger (Boston Chapter),Hyperledger-Boston,http://www.meetup.com/Hyperledger-Boston/,0.0,1458314547000,"![](http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/5/1/e/600_448325406.jpeg)

**Does The Hyperledger Project have the potential to become the engine behind
most successful decentralized applications and organizations created in the
next 25-50 years? Absolutely!**

A much better question is how, and in what new ways, can we:

a) Build decentralized applications, organizations and APIs at 10x the speed
at 1/10 the cost.

b) Build situational awareness in the local community.

I believe that the convergence of decentralized applications, decentralized
organizations, artificial intelligence and IoT brings upon us the Great
Displacement of the 21st century, where the majority of workforce will be left
without “conventional” jobs, forced to learn new skills and professions.

**Why?**

Founders of this group believe that the Hyperledger Foundation will be the
engine behind decentralization of the world, a massive economic change of the
next 25-50 years.

So.... why don't we standardize and democratize the field with and around
Hyperledger?

**What?**

We are a local micro community of those interested in advancing their
knowledge of Hyperledger, its use cases and applications.

**How?**

Join our group for a regular dose of human interaction, conversations, smiles,
food and drinks on all things Hyperledger:

• Use Cases

• Competitive analysis of Hyperledger startups (Distributed Apps from
disruptive companies in specific vertical markets)

• How-To’s

• Interviews with individuals working at the edge of the Hyperledger project

• Reviews of tools, services and APIs offered by the Hyperledger ecosystem

• Best Practices in Application Architecture

• Do’s and Don’ts

• Application Templates

• Hackathons

• Security in the decentralized world - on the edge, on the node, in the cloud
and in transit

• How others solve some of the hard problems that exist in the world using
Hyperledger.

**[https://www.hyperledger.org](https://github.com/hyperledger)**

**<https://github.com/hyperledger>**

**Join the movement. Let’s change the world. Because with Hyperledger we
can.**

Boston PHP is the largest education-focused Meetup in New England with more
than 3,700 members.

**We are a lot more than PHP!**

We have been [meeting since 2002](http://past.bostonphp.org) and usually meet
every month on a Wednesday. We have a wide range of topics all related to PHP,
Web Development, and Open Source technology.

All meetings are free, and we encourage everyone to participate and get
involved and help grow the PHP community. After each meeting we typically go
to a nearby restaurant/bar/pub for more informal discussion.

Our **99 Percent Solution** strategy offers services beyond monthly meetups.
For example, we have developed four virtual self-study groups that are run
year-round: PHP Percolate!, jQuery jAM, HTML5 Brunch and Drupal Diner.  More
than 175 members have been enshrined on our [Self-Study Group | Wall of
Accomplishment](http://www.meetup.com/bostonphp/messages/boards/thread/21414292).

In addition, more than 100 members receive job postings from other members via
our [Boston PHP Job Board
(beta)](http://www.meetup.com/bostonphp/messages/boards/thread/44803382).
